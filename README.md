# senior-design

<p> This repository is intended to keep the code developed for my senior design, entitled "Autonomous Navigation for Biped Robots". I developed a occupation grid algorithm, a fuzzy logic module for gaze control and another fuzzy logic module for autonomous navigation for NAO robots, in the context of Robot Soccer. This project uses a cross-compiler called "NAOqi", in order to be executed by real and simulated NAO robots.</p>
